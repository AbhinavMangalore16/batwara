# Batwara -Graph-Powered Expense Splitter

**Batwara** (Hindi for "sharing" or "division") is my antidote to the chaos that erupts after group dinners, trips, and shared subscriptions. If you've ever had to untangle five different debts and wished for a calculator and peace treaty rolled into one, this app is for you.

Unlike traditional bill-splitting apps that stuff every relationship into a rigid table, Batwara embraces complexity by using two databases:

- **Neo4j** to map friendships and debts as a living graph. Debts are edges, people are nodes, and relationships update in real time.
- **PostgreSQL** as the immutable ledger of receipts, splits, and final settlements.

A clever heap-based algorithm then takes that messy graph, crunches numbers, and spits out the cleanest, simplest set of payments possible. No more five payment apps open at once.

## ✨ What Makes Batwara Tick?

### 📊 Graph‑Based Debt Tracking
Neo4j naturally represents the `OWES` and `SETTLEMENT` edges between users. You can query the graph to see who owes whom at any moment.

### 🧠 Smart Debt Simplification
Instead of a tangle of IOUs, Batwara runs a Min/Max Heap algorithm to match the biggest debtor with the biggest creditor and reduce the whole web to the fewest transfers.

### 💸 Flexible Splitting Options
Need an equal share, exact amounts, or a percentage? Batwara handles all three with ease.

### 🗄️ Dual‑Database Architecture
PostgreSQL stores immutable records (`bills`, `splits`, `settlements`) while Neo4j powers dynamic balance calculations and graph traversals.

### 💻 Clean React UI
A minimal dashboard shows your net balance and who you need to pay next, without fluff.

## 🗄️ Data Model

**PostgreSQL** holds the permanent records:
- `bill` — who paid, amount, split method
- `split` — breakdown of the bill
- `settlement` — simplified payouts ready to be executed

**Neo4j** maps the relationships:
- `Person` nodes
- `[OWES]` edges for raw debts
- `[SETTLEMENT]` edges for optimized transfers

Balances are computed on the fly: `balance = totalReceived - totalOwed`.

## 🚀 The Settlement Algorithm

Here's the magic:

1. Compute each users net balance from the Neo4j graph.
2. Split the group into **Creditors** (positive balance) and **Debtors** (negative balance).
3. Use two heaps to efficiently match the highest creditor with the highest debtor.
4. Record a single settlement edge for that pair, adjust balances, and repeat.

The result? A tiny list of direct payments that settle everyone up in one go.
